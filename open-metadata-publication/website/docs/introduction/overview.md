# Our solution (overview)

![Distrubted operation](egeria-distributed-operation.png)

Today's organizations have their tools and technologies distributed across multiple data
centres and cloud providers (green clouds). Within each location, we can run a platform
(blue boxes) that provides integration services tailored to specific types of tools (orange
circles).

!!! tip "Peer-to-peer network of metadata"
    The resulting exchange of metadata (blue arrows) creates a peer-to-peer network that
    spans both locations and vendor tools.

Egeria implements a set of open [metadata types](types/), [frameworks](frameworks/),
[connectors](adapters/), [APIs](services/), event payloads and interchange protocols to
allow all types of tools and metadata repositories to share and exchange metadata. It also
provides this platform and pre-built integration services that can run within it to provide
a comprehensive toolkit for integrating and distributing metadata between different
tools and technologies.

## OMAG Server Platform

Egeria provides the platform (the blue boxes), called the _Open Metadata and Governance
Server Platform_ (or "OMAG Server Platform").

The OMAG Server Platform is a multi-tenant platform that supports horizontal scale-out in
Kubernetes and yet is light enough to run as an edge server on a Raspberry Pi. This platform
is used to host the actual metadata integration and automation capabilities.

## OMAG Server

Within an instance of the _OMAG Server Platform_, one or more _OMAG Servers_ can be
configured (the orange circles). These servers implement the wide range of integration and
automation capabilities, for example:

- [Open Metadata Repository Services (OMRS)](../services/omrs.md) enable the low-level exchange of metadata
  between platforms.
- [Open Metadata Access Services (OMAS)](../services/omas.md) provide higher-level, consumer-centric APIs for
  interacting with subsets of metadata.

... and many more:

- The [Services](../services/omrs.md) tab provides an exhaustive list and deeper explanations
  of each type of service that can be hosted in the platform.
- The [Adapters](../adapters/repos.md) tab provides a list of existing integrations with
  various tools, that implement the interfaces defined by the services.
- The [Frameworks](../frameworks/alf.md) tab provides details of the frameworks that both
  the services and adapters can use to simplify their integrations and provide consistency.

## Summary

Combined, the OMAG Server Platforms and Servers running within them provide an enterprise
catalog of data and IT resources that are transparently assessed, governed and consumed
through many types of tools and technologies. The enterprise catalog is not a
physically-centralized one, but a logical one composed of federated metadata from across
this peer-to-peer network.

!!! question "Why open source?"
    Delivering this capability as open source is a critical part of the project,
    since multiple vendors must buy into this ecosystem. They are not going to do this if
    one organization dominates the technology base. Thus, the open metadata and governance
    technology must be freely available with an open source governance model that allows a
    community of organizations and practitioners to develop and evolve the base, and then use
    it in their offerings and deployments.
